{"prompt": "", "completion": "QUESTION: Can birds get allergies?\\nDESCRIPTION:When the weather is nice, I often take my bird's cage outside (the cage door is closed, of course) so they can enjoy the fresh air. It's been a freakishly warm April, so I did this last Thursday and, ever since, my 9-year-old budgerigar has been breathing heavily and sneezing constantly. Her behavior,... show more\\nUpdate: Thank you, Budgie+Dogs, and thank you, Gertie. I took my budgie to the vet yesterday. He didn't seem too concerned for the same reason that I wasn't extremely concerned - other than the breathing and the sneezing, she's fine.

He didn't seem too concerned for the same reason that I wasn't extremely concerned - other than the breathing and the sneezing, she's fine. We've started her on Baytril and my vet says we can come back in 2 weeks... show more\\nUpdate 3: I'm sorry, not Gertie, Girtie.\\nANSWER: I don't think it is allergies either, but it could be something irritating her nose or throat such as dust or something like that, not necessarily allergies. If it keeps happening, take her to the vet to be sure. I have chickens and after they eat really fast, sometimes they sneeze with a high pitched squeak, this results from a seed being stuck to their throat and they cant swallow it, they sometimes gasp for air, but they are fine after they take a drink. Also they breathe heavily if they can't breathe thought their nose, if it gets clogged with dirt or something, so you can just clean it out with water or something.\\nI hope this helps and good luck with your bird!"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "QUESTION: From your experience, does TJ Maxx administer a drug test to potential employees?\\nDESCRIPTION:Before or after being hired? If so, what type do they use? Specifically for VA or MA locations. Please do not reply with a lecture about whether or not to use drugs.\\nANSWER: The answer is very simple, yes, they may do drug testing! I remember one time many years ago when I interviewed for a job at a major bank. Before they would even interview you, you had to take a drug test. And if you refused, then you'd have no interview and were dismissed right then and there!\\nNow some places have a company-wide policy in which all their stores operate in the same way. So if the company says we do drug testing, then all their stores do it too. Other companies have some company-wide policies, but leave some flexibility on the part of their individual stores. So one store may want to drug test, while another might choose not to.\\nEither way, if you don't do drugs, then you should have nothing to worry about. And if you do drugs, then you should be fully-aware that yes, you may be asked to take a drug test. Remember, drug testing can happen at any stage of the hiring process! So it could be the very first thing they'll do. Or it could be done later on.\\nIt can even be done after you've started working there. And if so and you fail, then you could be terminated immediately. I've seen this happen before! And finally, there are a growing number of employers who do regular drug testing of employees at random. So if you do drugs, just be aware of all this! And FYI, I've seen long-time employees let go because they just happened to get caught at some point. So even if it's 20 years later, eventually you'll get caught and pay a big price."}

It IS, however, normal to ejaculate. This is not urine. It is clear and doesn't really have a smell. (You'll know if it's urine if it is smelly)\\nIt comes from a build up of fluid in the female prostate (the G-spot).\\nSome guys can be freaked out if this happens, cause they think you've peed on them. Google G-spot squirt videos, and see if this looks like what happened. \\nThis will happen even if you empty your bladder before sex (that's the obvious way to make sure it's not pee!), and remember to always pee again after sex to avoid UTI's!"}
