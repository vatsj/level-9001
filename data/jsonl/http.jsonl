It's been a freakishly warm April, so I did this last Thursday and, ever since, my 9-year-old budgerigar has been breathing heavily and sneezing constantly. Her behavior, however, is completely normal. She's not sitting in a corner fluffed up and sickly;  she's running around, cheeping at the top of her lungs, and taking baths in her water bowl. She does not appear cold or fluffed at all (I actually put a heater near her cage thinking that she might have chills, and she moved away from it almost immediately). Her stool is normal. \nIs it possible that pollen or other irritants in the air could have caused this in her? I was very worried when I first noticed her breathing late Friday afternoon (too late to call the vet), but other than the sneezing and her labored breathing, she appears perfectly normal. If it is not allergies, does anyone know what else it could be?\n\nUpdate: \nThank you, Budgie+Dogs, and thank you, Gertie. I took my budgie to the vet yesterday. He didn't seem too concerned for the same reason that I wasn't extremely concerned - other than the breathing and the sneezing, she's fine. We've started her on Baytril and my vet says we can come back in 2 weeks...\n show more \n Thank you, Budgie+Dogs, and thank you, Gertie. I took my budgie to the vet yesterday.

If it keeps happening, take her to the vet to be sure. I have chickens and after they eat really fast, sometimes they sneeze with a high pitched squeak, this results from a seed being stuck to their throat and they cant swallow it, they sometimes gasp for air, but they are fine after they take a drink. Also they breathe heavily if they can't breathe thought their nose, if it gets clogged with dirt or something, so you can just clean it out with water or something.  \n\nI hope this helps and good luck with your bird! \n\n\n\n\n Source(s): \n \n\n\nGirtie\n \u00b7 6 years ago \n\n\n\n\n\n1\nThumbs up\n\n\n\n0\nThumbs down\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAdd a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00b7 just now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Abuse\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

If so, what type do they use? Specifically for VA or MA locations.

I remember one time many years ago when I interviewed for a job at a major bank. Before they would even interview you, you had to take a drug test. And if you refused, then you'd have no interview and were dismissed right then and there! \n\nNow some places have a company-wide policy in which all their stores operate in the same way. So if the company says we do drug testing, then all their stores do it too. Other companies have some company-wide policies, but leave some flexibility on the part of their individual stores. So one store may want to drug test, while another might choose not to. \n\nEither way, if you don't do drugs, then you should have nothing to worry about. And if you do drugs, then you should be fully-aware that yes, you may be asked to take a drug test. Remember, drug testing can happen at any stage of the hiring process! So it could be the very first thing they'll do. Or it could be done later on.  \n\nIt can even be done after you've started working there. And if so and you fail, then you could be terminated immediately. I've seen this happen before! And finally, there are a growing number of employers who do regular drug testing of employees at random. So if you do drugs, just be aware of all this! And FYI, I've seen long-time employees let go because they just happened to get caught at some point. So even if it's 20 years later, eventually you'll get caught and pay a big price. \n\n\n\n\n Source(s): \n \n\n\nmsoexpert\n \u00b7 6 years ago \n\n\n\n\n\n0\nThumbs up\n\n\n\n1\nThumbs down\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAdd a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00b7 just now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Abuse\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
